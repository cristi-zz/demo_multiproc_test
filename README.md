## PyTesting while multiprocessing?
### No worries! Read on!

This a demonstration of Python (py)testing while multiprocessing.

## Setup and run:

Setup is based on anaconda. I like to fix only the major packages, the rest, should be installed at their best version available.

    conda create -y --copy -n demo-mp python=3.9.2 pytest pytest-mock pytest-cov

That's it. Load the code in your IDE, configure it and run the tests, of course! Check the blog post for more descriptions!
